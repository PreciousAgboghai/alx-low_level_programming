* 0-main.c, main.h: This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
* 1-main.c: Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
* 2-largest_number.c, main.h: This program prints the largest of three integers, fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case
* 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h: This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration, fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
